## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing hotel booking data to derive insights and inform strategic decisions for optimizing bookings and advertising efforts. By examining key trends and patterns in the data, we aim to enhance our marketing strategies, improve guest retention, and ultimately increase overall revenue.

## Key Insights

1. **Preference for City Hotels**: The analysis indicates that the majority of bookings are for city hotels. This suggests a strong preference among our guests for urban accommodations.
2. **High Cancellation Rates**: There is a notable rate of cancellations, potentially influenced by our current deposit policies.
3. **Seasonal Demand Peaks**: Bookings peak during the summer months of May to August, indicating a seasonal trend.
4. **Western European Guest Majority**: A significant portion of our guests come from Western Europe.
5. **Lack of Repeat Guests**: We currently have a low rate of repeat guests, highlighting an area for improvement in guest loyalty and retention.

## Strategic Recommendations

1. **Targeting City Hotels**:
    - Allocate a majority of our advertising funds towards promoting city hotels to capitalize on the observed preference.

2. **Revising Deposit Policies**:
    - Examine and potentially revise our deposit policies to find a balance that minimizes cancellations while ensuring revenue.

3. **Advertising During Peak Months**:
    - Strategically allocate a substantial portion of our budget to advertising during the peak summer months (May to August) to capture heightened demand.

4. **Focusing on Western European Markets**:
    - Concentrate advertising efforts in Western Europe and tailor campaigns to the preferences and interests of Western European travelers.

5. **Building Guest Loyalty**:
    - Invest in marketing strategies that foster guest loyalty and encourage return visits, such as implementing loyalty programs and personalized promotions.
